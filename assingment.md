# Build a React Web App

## Assignment Overview

Build a basic web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The application should have the following features:

1. A search bar that allows users to enter a query and search for books.
2. A list of results that displays the title, author, and cover image of each book.
3. A "View Details" button next to each result that, when clicked, displays a modal window with more detailed information about the book (such as the publisher, publication date, and a summary).
4. A way to paginate the results, showing a maximum of 10 results per page.
5. The ability to sort the results by relevance or by publication date (ascending or descending).

## Technical Requirements

- The application should be built using React with Typescript.
- The application should be a single page app (no reloading).
- The application should use the Google Books API to search for books and retrieve detailed information about them.
- The application should be well-structured and easy to understand.
- The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
